{"text":"The about page is now fully updated so the team section is accurate for Lapel, showing just the three real team members (Alex Morgan, Jamie Chen, Taylor Wright) with crisp, company-specific bios and professional headshot images in a consistent style.\n\nThere is no evidence of any real investors for Lapel, so the investors section should be removed.
