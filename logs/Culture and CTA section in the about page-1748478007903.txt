customer digital twin</h2>  \n<p>Lapel creates a living, unified profile of each customer by automatically capturing every interaction—emails, calls, chats, meetings—and connecting it with structured data from your entire stack. Now every team can see the full picture and act with context.</p>\n\n<h3>No more stitching systems together</h3>  \n<p>Your CRM shows you deals. Your helpdesk knows tickets. Your analytics team sees dashboards. But none of them actually know your customer. Lapel connects fragmented tools and workflows into one shared source of truth—updated in real time as conversations happen.</p>\n\n<h3>Move from reactive to intelligent</h3>  \n<p>Turn raw interactions into outcomes. Respond faster, personalize better, and prevent churn before it starts using Lapel’s intelligent customer graph and behavior-triggered playbooks that learn and adapt over time.</p>\n\n<h3>Everyone speaks customer, now</h3>  \n<p>Your support team, CSMs, sales reps, and exec team all depend on customer insight—but they rarely see the same version of a customer’s story. With Lapel in place, every team gets the current, complete context baked into every workflow.</p>\n\n<h2>What you get with Lapel</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A single, continuously updating data layer for customer interactions</li>\n  <li>Fully searchable history of every email, chat, meeting, and note</li>\n  <li>Unified identity stitching across tools and departments</li>\n  <li>Intelligent customer relationship graph auto-maintained in real time</li>\n  <li>Playbooks that automatically take action when customers behave a certain way</li>\n  <li>Secure APIs to build workflows across internal tools and data warehouses</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Turn every customer conversation into a growth opportunity</h2>  \n<p>Lapel cuts down on context-switching, missed signals, and manual busywork by giving your teams all the insight they need—without searching, asking, or guessing. Quality of service goes up. Headcount stayed flat. Everyone wins.</p>\n\n<h2>Who it’s for</h2> \n<p>Lapel is built for ambitious customer-facing teams—support, success, ops, revenue, product—who want a shared baseline for understanding their users, automating smart next steps, and building stronger relationships at scale.</p>\n\n<h2>Make your whole team 10x sharper</h2>  \n<p>No more digging through email threads or Slacking someone for context. Lapel keeps everyone in sync and always ready. Close faster. Help better. Serve smarter.</p>\n\n<button>Request early access</button>  \n<p>Service at internet scale starts here.</p>"}],"finishReason":"tool-calls","usage":{"promptTokens":13463,"completionTokens":240,"totalTokens":13703},"warnings":[],"request":{},"response":{"id":"gen-1748477953-qe1htPmEow9RqtdeluN7","timestamp":"2025-05-29T00:19:15.790Z","modelId":"openai/gpt-4.1","headers":{"access-control-allow-origin":"*","cf-aig-cache-status":"MISS","cf-aig-event-id":"25ec5d1f-0507-49b5-bbd1-841a6656612d","cf-aig-log-id":"01JWCPGGZ91JCAZ1DHV99N4A7F","cf-aig-step":"0","cf-ray":"9471d1a62216651f-LHR","connection":"keep-alive","content-type":"application/json","date":"Thu, 29 May 2025 00:19:13 GMT","server":"cloudflare","set-cookie":"__cf_bm=_0CrPjTVhxA39CZdt5Si5OEaM07vXaHuWOyKf8y9UJM-1748477953-1.0.1.1-B3rN3eFLE39v.2EFEAa_6b.Cafslf8yItH7944gk.iDANTOwSmgfWrnfe.Sf1jyYn.N4BkgEw_9DKHC6G6iIsiLCsyZ4lncdPaHWn82CicM; path=/; expires=Thu, 29-May-25 00:49:13 GMT; domain=.gateway.ai.cloudflare.com; HttpOnly; Secure","transfer-encoding":"chunked","vary":"Accept-Encoding","x-clerk-auth-message":"Invalid JWT form.
