Headline should be concise, sentence case, and ambitious but approachable. Subtitle should extend the idea with 1 sentence about the impact of unifying customer data and enabling exceptional customer service at scale. \n\nTone: Professional, visionary, but not jargon-heavy. \n\nTarget audience: Operational leaders, customer teams, revenue ops in ambitious companies from scaleups to enterprise.\n\nContent details: The title and subtitle should both fit Lapel's real proposition. No clichés, banlist enforced.
